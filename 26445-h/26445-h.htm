<span class="i0">'Tis midnight's holy hour, and silence now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is brooding, like a gentle spirit o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The still and pulseless world. Hark! on the winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bell's deep tones are swelling; 'tis the knell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the departed year. No funeral train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is sweeping past; yet, on the stream and wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With melancholy light, the moonbeams rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a pale, spotless shroud; the air is stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As by a mourner's sigh; and, on yon cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That floats so still and placidly through heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spirits of the Seasons seem to stand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young Spring, bright Summer, Autumn's solemn form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Winter with its aged locks&mdash;and breathe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mournful cadences, that come abroad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the far windharps wild, touching wail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A melancholy dirge o'er the dead year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gone from the earth forever.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">'Tis a time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For memory and for tears. Within the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still chambers of the heart, a spectre dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose tones are like the wizard voice of time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard from the tomb of ages, points its cold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And solemn finger to the beautiful<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And holy visions, that have passed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left no shadow of their loveliness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the dead waste of life. The spectre lifts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coffin-lid of Hope and Joy and Love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bending mournfully above the pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet forms that slumber there, scatters dead flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er what has passed to nothingness.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">The year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has gone, and with it many a glorious throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of happy dreams. Its mark is on each brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its shadow in each heart. In its swift course,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It waved its sceptre o'er the beautiful;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they are not. It laid its pallid hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the strong man: and the haughty form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is fallen, and the flashing eye is dim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It trod the hall of revelry, where thronged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bright and joyous; and the tearful wail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of stricken ones is heard, where erst the song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reckless shout resounded. It passed o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The battle plain, where sword, and spear and shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashed in the light of midday; and the strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of serried hosts is shivered, and the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green from the soil of carnage, waves above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crushed and mouldering skeleton. It came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And faded like a wreath of mist at eve;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, ere it melted in the viewless air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It heralded its millions to their home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dim land of dreams.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Remorseless time!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce spirit of the glass and scythe! What power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can stay him in his silent course, or melt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His iron heart to pity! On, still on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He presses and forever. The proud bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Condor of the Andes, that can soar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through heaven's unfathomable depths, or brave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fury of the northing hurricane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bath its plumage in the thunder's home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Furls his broad wing at nightfall, and sinks down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rest upon his mountain crag; but Time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knows not the weight of sleep or weariness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Night's deep darkness has no chain to bind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rushing pinion.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Revolutions sweep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er earth, like troubled visions o'er the breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dreaming sorrow; cities rise and sink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like bubbles on the water; fiery isles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spring blazing from the ocean, and go back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their mysterious caverns; mountains rear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To heaven their bold and blackened cliffs, and bow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their tall heads to the plain; and empires rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathering the strength of hoary centuries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rush down, like the Alpine avalanche,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Startling the nations; and the very stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yon bright and glorious blazonry of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glitter awhile in their eternal depths,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like the Pleiad, loveliest of their train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoot from their glorious spheres, and pass away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To darkle in the trackless void; yet Time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time, the tomb-builder, holds his fierce career,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark, stern, all pitiless, and pauses not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the mighty wrecks that strew his path,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sit and muse, like other conquerors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the fearful ruin he hath wrought.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The morn is softly beautiful and still,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Its light, fair clouds in pencilled gold and gray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pause motionless above the pine-grown hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the pines, tranced as by a wizard's will,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yea! mute and moveless; not one flickering spray<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We catch a faint, thin murmur far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A bodiless voice, by grosser ears unheard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What voice is this? What low and solemn tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which, though all wings of all the winds seemed furled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor even the zephyr's fairy flute is blown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes thus forever its mysterious moan<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From out the whispering pine-tops' shadowy world?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah! can it be the antique tales are true?<br /></span>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
